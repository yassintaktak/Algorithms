Recursive backtracker algorithm

Make the initial cell the current cell and mark it as visited
While there are unvisited cells
If the current cell has any neighbours which have not been visited
Choose randomly one of the unvisited neighbours
Push the current cell to the stack
Remove the wall between the current cell and the chosen cell
Make the chosen cell the current cell and mark it as visited
Else if stack is not empty
Pop a cell from the stack
Make it the current cell
